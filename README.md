# UNIT 2 – Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## AIM
To design mobile and web layouts for an existing case study by applying Gestalt principles, UI elements, interaction behaviors, usability guidelines, and branding through logo creation.

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today’s digital landscape, effective UI/UX design is essential for the success of mobile and web applications. This experiment aims to enhance layouts by leveraging Gestalt principles, UI components, usability standards, and consistent branding.

## DESIGN STEPS

### A. Applying Gestalt Principles to Layout Design

- **Proximity**: Group related interface elements for better clarity
- **Similarity**: Maintain visual consistency for actions and categories
- **Continuity**: Guide users naturally through content flow
- **Closure**: Use design elements that lead to complete visual forms
- These principles help users intuitively navigate the interface and enhance comprehension.

## DESIGNS

### Mobile and Web Layout with Branding

*(Images or links to Figma/Canva designs can be added here)*  
- Mobile layout reflects simplified navigation and larger touch targets  
- Web layout leverages structured grid for desktop viewing  
- Unified branding applied across both formats

## FLOWCHART OF USER INTERACTION

*(Insert or link a flowchart image here – e.g., created in Miro, draw.io, or Figma)*  
Describes user actions from landing on homepage → browsing items → interacting with UI → completing key tasks.
